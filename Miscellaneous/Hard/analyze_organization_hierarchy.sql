-- approach : Recursive CTE used (Hard leetcode SQL problem ever)

with recursive cte as (
    select employee_id, employee_name, manager_id, 1 as level
    from Employees
    where manager_id is null
    union 
    select e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.manager_id, c.level+1 as level
    from Employees as e
    inner join cte as c
    on e.manager_id = c.employee_id 
),
cte2 as (
    select employee_id, employee_id as manager_id
    from Employees
    union
    select e.employee_id, c2.manager_id
    from cte2 as c2
    inner join Employees as e
    on c2.employee_id=e.manager_id
),
cte3 as (
    select c1.employee_id, c1.employee_name, c1.level, c2.manager_id, c2.employee_id as eid, e.salary
    from cte as c1
    inner join cte2 as c2
    on c1.employee_id=c2.manager_id
    inner join Employees as e
    on c2.employee_id=e.employee_id
)
select employee_id, employee_name, level, 
count(distinct if(employee_id!=eid, eid, null)) as team_size, 
sum(salary) as budget 
from cte3
group by employee_id, employee_name, level
order by level, budget desc, employee_name;
